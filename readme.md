# end.site
all code and assets for my personal site and blog at https://endy-boi.neocities.org !!

## Update Rules
These are the rules I have to follow when making updates or adding new pages

### Blog
- Posts must be in /pages/blog/pages/
- Posts must be formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD_[a-zA-Z0-9!#$%&()].html` ("MM" is not optional, must be 2 chars so no 4 must be 04)

### Projects
- Posts are generated from the ../snippets/posts/ folder json files
- Post resources are stored in the resource/ dir of their respective type (../2d/resources/, etc.)

## TODO:
- Python site generator (no/minimal JS, main site should work without JS)
- Rework header to be NICE
- Rebuild stylesheet to use variables for easy editing
- rework socials page into Contacts, make better (no dropdowns, lists)
- finish DC Encoder
- debug DC Decoder/Encoder (kidnap some testers)
- write library propaganda post (blog)
- starter guide to building a website (SSGs, hosts, code, etc.)
- USA legal resources post
- playable audio in Creations/Music
- option for more paragraphs in post generator (for loop based on postParas)
- last.fm recently played widget (may need supporter, or python implementation)
- add guestbook (supporter, or python implementation)
- move more projects onto site
- join (or start :3) webrings
- RSS integration (select for category, blog/project-type. python implementation)
- figure out how to render scroll bar under header/footer
