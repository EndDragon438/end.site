      <p>About:<br>Name: Moon Moon<br>Tribe: Night/Rain<br>Location: Rainforest – everywhere!<br>Pronouns: she/her, they/them, it/its, xe/xem, moon/moon<br>Queerities: Genderflux, Pan, Polyam<br>Age: 9 (22 human)<br>Height: 7.3m<br><br>Biography:<br>&emsp;Moon Moon was born and raised in the rainforest by their Rainwing mother and Nightwing father. Her mother decided to have Moon Moon’s name be a nod to Nightwing culture, but thought it would be funny to have a little fun with it. She originally wanted Moon Moon’s name to be three 'Moon's, for each of the three moons, but that was vetoed by its father as it stretched even his limits. Moon Moon loves life, and is exuberant beyond most dragons abilities to comprehend. Their favorite thing in the world is exploring new places and meeting new dragons. She really enjoys anything new. She loves Gharial’s town, and visits frequently bringing news, new things, and helping out wherever it can. They are determined to help Amaranth, and tries to show up whenever she can to drag him into trying something new.<br>Check out art other people have done of him on <a href='https://artfight.net/character/attacks/3338644.moon-moon'>artfight</a>!</p>
