      <p>About:<br>Name: Amaranth<br>Tribe: Skywing<br>Location: Possibility<br>Pronouns: he/him<br>Queerities: Transmasc, Bisexual<br>Age: 12 (28 human)<br><br>Biography:<br>&emsp;Amaranth was raised by his mother in a small village on the edge of the Skywing kingdom. His father died in the Succession War, and he hardly remembers him. When Amaranth grew up, he moved to a small hut in the outskirts of Possibility. He makes a living doing odd jobs around town, living day-to-day. He enjoys (or what little he can enjoy) reading fiction (~escapism~) and occasionally drawing. He has carried depression with him from leaving his hometown, and itâ€™s expressed with a lot of anger. He is lonely, and upset with himself more than anything.<br>Check out art other people have done of him on <a href='https://artfight.net/character/attacks/3129175.amaranth'>artfight</a>!</p>
