Gharial decides to start a small town up the Diamond Spray River, built specifically for veterans of the 20 year war. She brings some friends along with her to get the town off the ground. Her sibs know of her plans, and in their respective journeys send the friends they meet to the town. Gharial slowly grows her town, and learns a lot along the way.
