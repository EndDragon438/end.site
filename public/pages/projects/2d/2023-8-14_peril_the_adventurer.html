            &emsp;this is a piece i made when i was working on a Peril WOF AU fic, where Peril becomes an adventurer! the piece took 4 hours, and was my biggest project at the time. it was meant to serve as a cover, for the fic i'd found a couple people to collaborate on with. i did make several different versions to be the cover, but kinda abandoned the fic once winter hit and my depression + school responsibilities took up more of my time. i still really like the au, and i really want to make some more for it! i might come back to the full fic sometime, but i'm not super into writing so i might make a comic or something instead
