 "postText": "&emsp;This is my Artiversary piece! It's a redraw of the first digital art I ever did. My process started in Blender with a dragon rig I made (which is why it looks a bit funky), and then I moved into Krita to work off my reference and finish it off. My improvement this year was amazing, I'm really proud of how far I've come. I used 3d in this piece not because I think it's higher quality, but because I want to record how i've progressed in both 2d and 3d this year."
