He was raised with looser rules than those living in the upper circles, and in his childhood discovered a love for nature and experiencing new things. He lived there all his life, until he met Moon Moon when she visited the kingdom. It visited as soon as the borders opened up more after Snowfall destroyed the Gift of Order. He was inspired and joined her on her next journeys, before eventually finding some adventures of his own. He and Moon Moon always meet up when they can though, sharing tales and plans for their next adventures. They rely on each other as a sort of support network, making sure the other is safe. Who knows? Maybe someday that friendship could blossom into something more…. ","postTags":["2023","oc-borealis","wof","writing"]}
