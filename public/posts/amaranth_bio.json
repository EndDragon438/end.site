His father died in the Succession War, and he hardly remembers him. When Amaranth grew up, he moved to a small hut in the outskirts of Possibility. He makes a living doing odd jobs around town, living day-to-day. He enjoys (or what little he can enjoy) reading fiction (***escapism***) and occasionally drawing. He has carried depression with him from leaving his hometown, and itâ€™s expressed with a lot of anger. He is lonely, and upset with himself more than anything.","postTags":["2023","oc-amaranth","wof","writing"]}
