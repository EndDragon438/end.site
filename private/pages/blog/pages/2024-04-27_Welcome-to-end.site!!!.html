                    &emsp;hello and welcome to <strong>end.site</strong>! after working on this little corner of the internet for about two weeks, i've decided it's probably about time i published a blog post!
                    i've been having a lot of fun working on this site, and i've learned <strong>a ton</strong> too. this site began as a little test, mostly just a header, that i'd made a while ago then just kinda left.
                    but, after 2 weeks of hyperfocus and only a <strong>little</strong> sleep deprivation, i've come a really long way! i'm still not in a place where i'm comfortable giving the site the glorious title of "v1.0" yet,
                    but that's partially what this blog post is about. currently, i'd say that the site is around v0.7, though i haven't really been keeping track. that version number is really good! especially for how little
                    time it's taken me to get to that point. however, there are still some big things missing that i feel like i have to finish before the site is actually ready.<br>&emsp;the first, and definitely main reason for
                    is also the reason this blog post isn't really visible right now. <strong>tags</strong>. oh glorious tags, you wonder of organizational engineering. you aspiration for all to strive for. you absolute nightmare to implement
                    on a static site with just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. so yeah, as you may have guessed, i'm trying to add tags!!! i'd love to be able to organize my stuff by it's contents, and tags seem (to me) like the best way to do that
                    unfortunately, without access to a backend database thing (grrrr curse you neocities static site (not really, this place is great :3)) it's kinda difficult to implement sitewide tags. there are several static site generators (SSGs),
                    frameworks, and other things that build tags straight in, but i, like the naive dumbfuck i am, decided to do it all by my lonesome. you see, i'm doing this project for several reasons, and the number one reason is that i
                    want to learn everything involved in building a website. using an SSG kind of takes away from that, it's a little bit too close to just hitting "post" on a social media site and calling it done. and so, i decided to do it myself.<br>&emsp;
                    i actually wanted to avoid using javascript entirely at the start, buuutttt once the site started getting more and more complex i reluctantly decided i needed a <strong>script</strong>. my breaking point was actually the header
                    you see across the site. i'm early enough in the development process that i was frequently making changes to the header (some of these are in the changelog) and having to manually do that for, hang on lemme count, <strong>6</strong>
                    pages was getting difficult for my AuDHD, 30 second memory lil smoothbrain to handle. so, i chucked the header into a JS script, loaded it on all my pages, and forgot about it. fast forward a bit (few days really) and, well,
                    i started trying to add tags. now, the first method (and most obvious) i thought of to add tags was to have a few picked out, then manually create pages for all of them and link to each page every time i made something
                    with tags. now, there are a few issues with this. the biggest one for me, is that i'm inconsistent as fuck and this would make adding new tags a big pain. i'd have to create a new page, setup links everywhere,
                    and maybe even go back to older posts that fit the new tag. so that option has been out for a while. to be honest, at the beginning that was kind of the only way i could think of to add tags.<br>&emsp;i didn't know anything about
                    databases, or backend (still don't actually) and i didn't even really know what a static site was, or what the limits of neocities were. so tagging has been a bit of a constant research thing for the past two weeks,
                    with me occasionally running into some source or another, or looking into this persons own tag system (or alternate organization). and through all that research, i found out a couple things. firstly, that to implement a true,
                    built in, simple tag system, i would need something that neocities doesn't make available. be that php, sql, or whatever, i just couldn't use it here. alternatively, some clever people had made use of specific formatting
                    with Javascript in order to organize all their stuff and do neat things with sorting and displaying posts, like showing a most recent post or having a random post button. since i'd already decided against using
                    an SSG, i chose the second option: Javascript. and that's kind of where i've been for the past few days. i made the decision a bit ago, but really the true work only just started today. i've been having a slow couple
                    of days, kind of winding down from the sleepless obsession i had over this site in the first week-and-a-bit.<br>&emsp;today, i got excited again. pretty much my whole day has been spent on this problem (though i have gotten <strong>very</strong>
                    distracted a few times), and i think that i'm <strong>nearly</strong> there. i came up with a way to grab the "tags" element on a post, tokenize that string into the individual tags, and then output a list of all the tags involved in
                    an array. unfortunately, i'd ran up against the "no backend" issue of neocities again, and my idea to use a database, or at least a lil txt to list all the tags on the site failed. that code is still in my script.js, just cause
                    i think it was cool, but i can't really use it for anything. after that direction turned out to be a dead end, i decided to manually list my tags in an array and see what i could do from there. i took a small detour to get the
                    "tagged" page on the creations page working automatically from the array, and then i ran into an issue. my plan at that point was to have JS automatically create new pages based on the names of my tags, and then automatically
                    populate those pages with the associated posts. it was gonna be all nice and pretty, and require hardly any effort on my part past the initial implementation. unfortunately, i haven't been able to figure out how to get JS
                    to make a whole new page, all on it's own. that's really unfortunate, cause if i actually can't do that it means i'd pretty much have to go back to my first idea of how to do tags: manually. i'd try my best to fit in
                    as much automation as i could with JS, but if it couldn't make pages it was gonna be a lot more work for me.<br>&emsp;and, that is where i'm at now. i took a break from this head-scratcher to make a blog post template, and write the
                    JS to have a lil bit of fun with the datetime on blog posts. that was nice and relaxing, most of the stuff i needed i'd already learned from trying to figure out tags, like tokenization and concatenation in JS.
                    i even (and i thought this was super smart) stored all the month names in an array, then selected the index based off the listed datetime on the article instead of having a massive if/else chain. ok, well i thought it was cool.<br>&emsp;
                    sadly, this is pretty much all i have to share for now, which means i might have to go back to the tags issue. honestly, i might just skip it for now. i may just plug in a shitty lil manual tag thing (hopefully temporary)
                    just to get the site in a usable state. i've been waiting on tags to do a lot of things, like make this blog post or put my art on the creations pages. if anyone knows how to generate a page with JS, please let me know!!!
                    until then though, i think i'll try to get the site to a v1.0, even if it's not quite what i hoped.<br>&emsp;wish me luck!!
