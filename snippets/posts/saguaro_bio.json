Living off of the pension from Queen Thorn (a new custom, generously provided to all veterans of the war) as well as odd jobs around town. They generally avoid dragons, especially new ones but enjoy being around their friends (though they would hate to admit it). Saguaro can manage just about anything they put their mind to, and as such they’re often called on for particular tasks a dragon can’t figure out themselves.","postTags":["2023","oc-saguaro","wof","writing"]}
