 "postText": "&emsp;This was a demo of a gun skin. The gun is one a modelled a while back, I'm calling it the FLR .50 Prime, cause it's a .50 BMG bolty and the first gun I modelled. The skin is one me and a friend thought up a while back, I thought I'd finally try to make it a thing. I had fun working with textures that aren't procedural, I had to figure out how to link up the image texture to Krita so I could get live edits. I tried to go for a bit of a spray-painted look, but it's a bit hard to tell in this lighting."
